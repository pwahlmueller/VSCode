# VSCode
Here are my VSCode settings.

## Settings.json
These are my settings with these features:

* variables are one word (including $)
* MouseWheel zooms
* handles German Umlaute correctly 
* Active Window defines the document type of a new window
* Colorize borders and title with peacock (if peacock installed)
* Terminal cache up to 5000 lines (needed)
* git Confirmations disabled
* Testsettings for faster intellisense

## Keybindings.json
These are my Keybindings. Keep in mind, I'm a PowerShell Guy, so the bindings originate at the PowerShell ISE.

* SQL/F5 : Execute all
* SQL/F8 : Execute Line (not perfect for complex SQL code)
* SQL/CRTL+SHIFT+e : Removed execute all
* SQL/CTRL-Q A : Convert lines to SQL Array
* POWERSHELL/CTRL-Q A : Convert lines to PowerShell Array
* MARKDOWN/CTRL-Q A : Convert lines to PowerShell Array

## psprofile.ps1
